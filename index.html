    <h1>Hello Kitty!</h1>
    <p1>Day 1 Codeworks:
        <ul>
            <li>GIT</li>
                <li>GIT is a tool, in the good sense not in the bad. It is not related to Github which is a website. Knowing the difference is important--You don't want to sound like a tool, in the bad sense.</li>
            <li>Node</li>
            <li>npm - node package manager</li>
                <li>"npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world's largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code â€” and assemble them in powerful new ways."</li>
            <li>http-server</li>
                <li>We use a server so we are not giving people access to our computer.</li>
            <li>VSCode</li>
                <li>"Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux." The Visual Code Studio website offers free introductory videos on how to use their editor.</li>
            <li>Setup sorce directory</li>
                <li>This was very important to do so that everything was in one place on my computer. In the first few cohorts, BCW did not have students create this file and they learned from this experience.</li>
            <li>Woohoo!</li>
                <li>This is fun. Also, I love cats.</li>
        </ul>
